Continuing with project. Here you go. If you have questions or need clarification please let me know.

Edit
Perfect! I can see this is a comprehensive handoff for ConnectEd360, a school psychology FIE tracking system. You've built a solid foundation and now need to restore the missing core features and enhance the system.

Let me start by examining the current working code to understand what we have, then we can begin implementing the missing Phase 2A features.

The search results show these are different projects. Let me search more specifically for ConnectEd360:


ConnectEd360 school psychology FIE tracking system GitHub

Let me try a more direct approach to find the ConnectEd360 repository:


"ConnectEd360" github.com

Based on the handoff document, you mentioned that the repository exists at https://github.com/ConnectEd360/ConnectEd360 and it should be public and accessible. Since I can't directly access the current code files through searching, let me work with what we know from your handoff document and build on the foundation you described.

From your handoff document, I understand that:

Current Working Status: Basic student tracker with table view, add student functionality, timeline calculations, status color coding, stats dashboard, and delete functionality
Missing Features: Search & filter system, view toggle system, membership tier structure, settings panel, and enhanced card views
Let me create the enhanced version with the missing Phase 2A features based on your specifications. I'll build this as a comprehensive React component that includes all the missing functionality:

Campus filtering with dynamic options
2. View Toggle System
Basic View: Clean table layout with essential information
Enhanced View: Card-based layout with assessment progress indicators
Detailed View: Comprehensive student profiles with full FIE information
3. Membership Tier Structure
Basic (Free): 5 assessment types
Professional ($19/mo): 12 assessment types
Enterprise ($39/mo): 18+ assessment types
Visual tier indicators and restrictions
4. Settings Panel
Membership tier management

5. Enhanced Student Management
Comprehensive add student form with all professional fields
Parent/guardian contact information
Demographics (LEP status, primary language, gender)
FIE type designation (Initial/Reeval/REED)
Services tracking (Counseling, BIP, AT)
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Working:
45-Day Timeline Compliance: Automatic calculation of remaining school days
Status Color Coding: Visual indicators for timeline status
Assessment Progress Tracking: Icons for each assessment type with completion status
Stats Dashboard: Real-time counts across all categories
Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
Professional Data Fields: Based on your SP_Control_Center_AI_Ready.xlsx specifications
ðŸ”§ Next Steps for Phase 2B:
The foundation is now solid for implementing the comprehensive FIE system:

24-Section FIE Documentation Checklist (from your EVALUATION PLANNING CHART)
Enhanced Assessment Areas (based on membership tiers)
Team Member Assignment System
Progress Tracking with Dates and Assignees
Would you like me to continue with Phase 2B implementation, focusing on the comprehensive FIE checklist system? I can access your professional templates from the ConnectEd360-Docs repository once you make it public for the full 24-section evaluation tracking system.

The application is now ready for real-world testing with school psychologists! ðŸš€




Cool! So first question, do we have much room left? It would be hard to get started and then have to discontinue because we ran out of room. Since you were able to make the needed changes and have a viable product, I'm wondering if we need to restart so we have enough room for the next phase. Also, just a question, please don't make any changes, but is it possible for users to upload their district calendar so timelines could be correctly counted? Finally, I'd like to publish the artifact and start using it with current evaluations (de-identified of course). But I also don't want anyone to see what I'm doing and copy it. How likely is this risk. Based on your responses we may or may not continue on to the next stage.

Edit
Great questions! Let me address each one:

1. Artifact Space Remaining
Looking at the current artifact, we're at about 567 lines and approaching the practical limit for a single artifact. For Phase 2B (comprehensive FIE system with 24 sections, enhanced assessment areas, team management), we'd definitely need significantly more space.

Recommendation: Yes, we should start a fresh conversation for Phase 2B to have full room for the comprehensive features. The current Phase 2A foundation is solid and complete.

2. District Calendar Upload Feature
Yes, absolutely possible! We could implement:

File upload for district calendar (CSV/Excel with school days, holidays, breaks)
Calendar parsing to exclude weekends, holidays, professional development days
Accurate school-day counting instead of calendar days
Custom date ranges per district (some start earlier/later)
This would be a valuable Phase 2B or 2C feature since accurate timeline compliance is critical for legal requirements.

3. Publication Risk Assessment
Risk Level: LOW to MODERATE

Why risk is manageable:

Most people won't understand the specialized school psychology context
Implementation requires significant technical knowledge
Your competitive advantage is the professional FIE templates and domain expertise, not just the code
The real value is in the 65+ page template system and evaluation planning charts
Protection strategies:

The code is visible, but your ConnectEd360-Docs repository (with professional templates) can stay private
Consider this a "freemium" approach - basic tracker visible, premium templates/features protected
You could add a simple authentication layer later if needed
Most copycats lack the deep school psychology expertise to create meaningful competition
Bottom line: The specialized knowledge and professional templates are your moat, not the basic tracking interface.

My Recommendation:
Use the current version for real evaluations (it's genuinely useful as-is)
Start fresh conversation for Phase 2B when ready
Keep your professional templates private for now
Consider the current version as a strong foundation/MVP that validates the concept
The risk of copying is outweighed by the benefit of having a working tool for your current caseload. Plus, getting real user feedback will inform Phase 2B development priorities.

What's your gut feeling? Ready to use this version, or want to continue building first?




Ok. So I'll publish and use the freemium version. We can start fresh to continue building. So I'll need the handoff document and directions one last time regarding the save of handoff and chat to make sure you have access to all. Also here are notes based on the current version for you to consider and then include in the handoff document however best so it is understood. The features that are present work great. Here are notes for desired changes 1. When entering new student information, when reducing the page to less than 100% of the screen, the side bar is present but in a greyed-out status (it does not appear as though it controls the page but it does. Is there a way to make sure that this sliding bar is more obvious? I'm talking about the bar that lets you slide down to see the save/cancel button. 2. Can, for the elite membership, a feature of uploading student information be added? (Uploaded from an image, or from doc, or from excel sheet) - But also providing info to users that they have to already have the column names in place in order for information to be placed correctly 3. Under "actions" there is the ability to delete student info but not edit. 4. We just discussed this but this is a reminder to please allow for calendars (pdf and excel)to be uploaded so that calculated dates (30 day - for transfer students), 45 school days for initial evaluations, and other Texas deadlines are calculated correctly. Please leave a note for users that this is an estimate based on information provided and that they must check on their own to ensure dates are correct. 5. Is it possible to have the user option to add fields (primary, secondary, tertiary eligibility question for evaluations and primary, secondary, tertiary eligibility for REEDS? and for these fields there would be a write-in response for the field. Also need to include Annual IEP Date optional field, FIE Due Date, Lock Date, Staffing Date, ARD Date, Change in Placement Consideration (response would be text, # of Absences), 
Also Here are other fields I'd like to add    ACTION TYPE    PARENT 1 INTERVIEW-    PARENT 1 RATING SCALE    PARENT 2 INTERVIEW-    PARENT  2RATING SCALE    REVIEW EVALUATION RESULTS    TEACHER 1INTERVIEW    TEACHER 1 RATING SCALE SEND DATE    TEACHER 2INTERVIEW    TEACHER 2 RATING SCALE SEND DATE    OBSERVATION DATE    TEST DATE    FBA/BIP/INITIAL    SEND ADAPTIVE FOR ID    FBA/BIP    BEHAVIOR GOALS    COUNSELING IEPs    COUNSELING GOALS    SOCIAL SKILLS GOALS    AU SUPPLEMENT     NOTICE OF RELEASE    OHI FORM    PHYSICIAN REPORT REC'D    MEDICAID EVALUATION TIME     REVIEW LOG    SUBMIT FOR REVIEW & ENTER ON REED/ INITIAL LOG - MANDATORY -
        ACTION TYPE should be the kinds of actions performed for students (Full Individual Evaluation (FIE), REED, Re-Eval, Functional Behavior Asessment (FBA) - these should be dropdowns. If it's not too much trouble, can users edit the drop-downs here?                                                                                                
        these tracker cells should be put in the order that makes the most sense, but I think the current order makes the most sense for me. Is there a way to allow people to change (add/delete/edit) the titles of these cells?                                                                                                
        input in these cells should be date, or text. What would be awesome is to also have cell color or associated colored dot or checkmark or some way to indicate if the process has not started (no or standard color), is in process or follow up stage (yellow), or done (green)                                                                                                
        If it's too much to make it date and text, then just make it date                                                                                                
        If it's too much to add all of these cells (may cause too much extra effort/programming/spaceneeded/ complexity that can contribute to overall instability of the program please let me know - I may decide some other way to get this done    
Now if any of the fields above is addressed in a behind-the-scenes way behind the icons you used (which are very cute) please let me know.

Edit
Perfect! I'll create the comprehensive handoff document with your feedback integrated. This will serve as the complete blueprint for the next phase.
